0). How to compile?
* Type "tar -xvf <tarname?" without quotes to unpack tarball
* Type "make" without quotes to build awget and ss.

1). AWGET
* The executable "awget" expects at most two arguments in the order "awget <URL> [-c chainfile]"
* If a chainfile argument is not supplied, it reads a local copy in the current directory, named chaingang.txt
* The URL is sanity checked via "basename"
* The URL supplied is expected to point to a file that exists. AWGET checks for existance via "wget --spider"
* If a file already exists with the same name, AWGET appends a timestamp to the new filename

2). SS
* The execcutable expects at most 1 argument, "ss [-p <port>]"
* If no port is supplied, ss binds to an availabe port at random
* Upon receieving the file (either by downloading from a ss or wget), it transmits the file in 5KB bursts (5 packets 1KB each)
* Larger files will take LONGER to download

3). How to run?
* On a command terminal, type "./ss -p <PORT>" or "./ss" without the quotes to launch the ss.
* On a command terminal, type "./awget <URL> -c <chainfile>" or "./awget <url>" without the quotes to launch awget.
